Assignment 2: Software Management by Lewis Fraser 976552
This is the documentation of Assignment 1: Virtual Worlds, this build is titled ‘The swimming Hall of Fame’. This is a real place in the world situated in Fort Lauderdale, Miami, Florida, USA. This is a state-of-the-art aquatic facility playing host to some of the world largest swimming and diving events in the world. This was chosen for this assignment as I have personal experience in this facility as I have swum here in competition in March 2023.
